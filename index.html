            <h2>UNIX Time</h2>

            <p id="UNIXtime-intro">
                UNIX time is a system for describing a point in time. 
                It is the number of seconds that have elapsed since
                the UNIX epoch, excluding leap seconds. 
                The UNIX epoch is 00:00:00 UTC on January 1970. 
                Unix time is nonlinear with a leap second having 
                the same Unix time as the second before it 
                (or after it, implementation dependent), so that every 
                day is treated as if it contains exactly 86400 seconds,
                with no seconds added to or subtracted from the day 
                as a result of positive or negative leap seconds. 
                Due to this treatment of leap seconds, UNIX time is 
                NOT a true representation of UTC.

            <p id="origin">
                The earliest versions of Unix time had a 32-bit
                integer incrementing at a rate of 60 Hz, which 
                was the rate of the system clock on the hardware 
                of the early Unix systems. The value 60 Hz still 
                appears in some software interfaces as a result. 
                The epoch also differed from the current value. 
                The first edition Unix Programmer's Manual dated
                3 November 1971 defines the Unix time as "the 
                time since 00:00:00, 1 January 1971, measured in
                sixtieths of a second".

            <h2>Why is it cooler than normal time?</h2>

            <p id="advantages">
                It has "UNIX" in it's name so it sounds cool. 
                Now seriously. One of the primary benefits of 
                using UNIX time is that it can be represented 
                as an integer making it easier to parse and 
                use across different systems.

        <div class="problem">
            <h2>Year 2038 Problem</h2>

            <p id="problem">
                UNIX time is stored as a signed 32-bit integer. 
                Such implementations cannot encode times after 
                03:14:07 UTC on 19 January 2038 (UNIX time value
                is showed on the timeline).
                Similar to the 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem">Y2K problem</a> 
                , the Year 2038 problem is caused by 
                an insufficient number of bits (digits) chosen 
                to represent time.
